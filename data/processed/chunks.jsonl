No. A TIN is your general taxpayer identification number used for all tax purposes, while VAT\nregistration is a specific process linked to your TIN for collecting and remitting Value Added Tax. You need a TIN before you can register for VAT. Q3: Can a business operate without a TIN? No. Operating without a TIN is illegal and puts your business at risk of fines, penalties, and legal\naction.
