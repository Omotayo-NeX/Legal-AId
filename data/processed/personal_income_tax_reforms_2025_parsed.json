      "text": "REFORMS OF THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX REGIME BRING\nIMPORTANT CHANGES\nNigeria Tax Act, 2025\nThe president of Nigeria signed into law the Nigeria Tax Act, 2025 (NTA) on 26 June 2025. The\nNTA repeals certain existing tax laws, including the Personal Income Tax Act (PITA) and\nconsolidates them into a single, unified legislation. It also introduces key reforms to Nigeria's\npersonal income tax regime, providing clearer rules on how income is determined, how individuals\nare assessed, taxed, and expected to comply.\nThe NTA will become effective from January 2026.\nWHY THIS MATTERS\nKey changes in the NTA for individuals and employers include a new definition of tax resident and\nnon-resident, changes to personal reliefs, revision of tax rates and the respective income bands,\namong others. The key changes, while aimed at reducing the tax burden of low-income earners,\ncould also result in higher taxes for higher-income earners, which may include individuals on\ninternational assignments.\nThe revised residence rules under the NTA could mean that assignees in Nigeria qualify as tax\nresidents where it is deemed they have a permanent home in the country for the purpose of their\nassignment. This would result in their worldwide income being taxable in Nigeria rather than just\ntheir Nigerian-sourced income. In addition, the increased tax rates, revised income bands, and the\nremoval of the Consolidated Relief Allowance (as discussed below) will raise the effective tax rate\nfor employees (from about 18 percent to 25 percent), creating higher costs for employers in respect\nof tax-equalised employees.\nFurthermore, trailing income linked to Nigerian employment is now expressly taxable even after an\nindividual's exit – in this regard, both employers and employees need to review processes to foster\naccurate tracking and compliance.\nOnce the NTA becomes effective, the changes affecting individuals may impact international\nassignment cost projections, hypothetical tax calculations, and payroll withholding processes.\nAccordingly, employers would need to re-assess their assignment cost projections, adjust payroll\nsystems, and consider updating their tax planning strategy where assignments to and from Nigeria\nare concerned.\nCONTEXT\nThe NTA represents one of the most significant tax reforms in Nigeria in over a decade. This reform\nis aimed at enhancing revenue generation, simplifying compliance procedures, and addressing\nregional disparities in tax administration. Three complementary pieces of legislation: Nigerian Tax\nAdministration Act, the Nigerian Revenue Service Act, and the Joint Revenue Board Establishment\nAct were also enacted to streamline tax administration in Nigeria.\nThe last major reform to Nigeria's personal income tax regime was in 2011 (effective from 2012),\nwith minor adjustments introduced through the Finance Acts between 2019 and 2023. Prior to now,\nneither the tax rates nor many of the rules governing individual taxation have been revised.\n",
