      "text": "NIGERIA TAX ACT, 2025\nThe Nigeria Tax Act, 2025 repeals and consolidates over a dozen federal tax laws into a single\nunified statute. It replaces legacy laws such as the Companies Income Tax Act (CITA), Personal\nIncome Tax Act (PITA), Capital Gains Tax Act (CGTA), Value Added Tax Act, and the Stamp\nDuties Act, among others. This consolidation aims to reduce fragmentation, promote consistency,\nand modernise Nigeria's tax framework for a digital and globally integrated economy.\nCorporate and Business Income Taxation\nThe Act introduces a clearer and more progressive corporate income tax structure:\n• Small companies (with an annual turnover of I50 million or less) are subject to a 0% companies\nincome tax rate.\n• Other companies are taxed at a rate of 30%, alongside a 4% Development Levy on assessable\nprofits, which replaces multiple sectoral levies (e.g., Education Tax, IT Levy, NASENI Levy).\nIt also introduces a minimum Effective Tax Rate (ETR) of 15%, in line with global tax reforms. This\napplies to multinational group entities with a consolidated global turnover of at least €750 million, or\nNigerian companies with turnover exceeding I50 billion. Where a foreign subsidiary pays tax at a\nrate below this threshold, the Nigerian parent is liable to pay the top-up tax.\nTo discourage tax base erosion, the Act incorporates Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) rules,\nbringing undistributed passive income of low-taxed foreign affiliates into Nigeria's tax net.\nCapital Gains Tax\nCapital gains tax now applies to disposals of digital and virtual assets, such as cryptocurrencies,\ntokens, and digital property. Reliefs are available for reinvested share sales, principal private\nresidences, and certain personal-use assets. Notably, gains on share disposals below I150 million\n(subject to a I10 million gain limit) are exempt.\nPersonal Income Tax\nThe Act introduces a progressive personal income tax regime, with tax rates ranging from 0% to\n25%, and improved deductions that support equitable burden-sharing. Individuals earning\nI800,000 or less annually are fully exempt from tax. A key reform includes a 20% rent deduction,\ncapped at I500,000, to ease the cost of housing for employees and low-income earners.\nValue Added Tax (VAT)\nVAT remains at 7.5%, but the Act substantially revises the scope and mechanics of the tax:\n• All taxable supplies of goods and services connected to Nigeria are chargeable.\n• Non-resident suppliers are now required to register and remit VAT, bringing e-commerce and\ndigital services squarely into the tax net.\n• Input VAT recovery has been expanded, especially for capital expenditure and input services,\nreducing cascading tax burdens.\nThe Act also refines the treatment of exempt and zero-rated goods and services:\n",

It\nresponds to years of fragmented tax administration by offering consistency, clarity of roles, and a\nrules-based system that aligns with global good practice.\nThe Act promotes fiscal federalism by clearly distinguishing the tax jurisdictions of different tiers of\ngovernment:\n• The Nigeria Revenue Service (NRS) is responsible for administering corporate income tax,\nvalue-added tax (VAT), taxes on petroleum operations, non-resident taxation, and national tax\nincentives.\n• State and FCT tax authorities retain powers over personal income tax for resident individuals\n(excluding military and diplomatic personnel) and local taxes.\nDigital Identity and Compliance\nThe Act mandates the issuance and use of a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) for every\ntaxable person. This TIN must be linked to all tax transactions and financial activities, reinforcing\nthe integrity of taxpayer records. Non-resident businesses and digital service providers deriving\nincome from Nigeria must also register and obtain a TIN.\nTo support transparency in the digital economy, Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), including\ncrypto exchanges and financial institutions, are required to report significant transactions. Banks\nmust provide quarterly returns on customer data and cumulative inflows or outflows exceeding I25\nmillion (for individuals) and I100 million (for companies).\nThe law also introduces a mandatory disclosure regime for tax planning arrangements, especially\nthose structured primarily to obtain a tax advantage.\nAssessments, Returns and Refunds\nThe NTAA formalises Nigeria's self-assessment regime, empowering taxpayers to file their own\nreturns and calculate tax liability. However, tax authorities retain the right to issue administrative\nassessments where returns are not filed or appear inaccurate.\nAssessments must generally be made within six years of the relevant tax period — unless there is\nfraud, wilful default, or gross misstatement, in which case there is no time limit. All taxes are\npayable in the currency of the transaction, with petroleum taxes payable in US Dollars.\nThe Act provides for tax refunds to be processed within 90 days (or 30 days for VAT), and also\nallows taxpayers to apply overpaid taxes to future liabilities (set-off). Claims must be made within\nsix years and must be accompanied by proper documentation.\nAudit, Enforcement and Penalties\nTax authorities are granted broad investigative powers. These include the right to:\n• Call for documents and inspect books and records, both physical and electronic;\n• Enter premises (with judicial warrant for private residences);\n• Remove or copy evidence;\n",

It repeals the Federal Inland Revenue Service (Establishment)\nAct, 2007, and formally establishes the Nigeria Revenue Service (NRS) as the central authority for\nthe assessment, collection, accounting, and enforcement of federally collectible taxes and other\ndesignated revenues.\nThe law reflects an evolution in both the structure and scope of tax administration at the federal\nlevel. Unlike its predecessor, the NRS is now empowered to operate within a broader institutional\nframework that encompasses both tax and select non-tax revenues such as petroleum royalties\nand statutory levies as well as data integration and inter-agency collaboration.\nMandate and Powers\nThe Act mandates the NRS to:\n• Administer and enforce all federal tax laws and collect revenues accruing to the Federation;\n• Assess and account for taxes, levies, and charges imposed by federal legislation;\n• Enforce compliance, including powers to trace, freeze, seize, or confiscate proceeds of tax fraud\nor evasion;\n• Collaborate with other national and international bodies for the exchange of tax information;\n• Maintain a centralised taxpayer database and issue Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TINs) in\ncollaboration with state tax authorities and the Joint Revenue Board.\nThe NRS is also empowered to assist subnational governments (State, FCT, and Local\nGovernment) in tax administration, when requested or where inter-agency collaboration is required\nby law.\nInstitutional Structure and Governance\nThe NRS is structured as an autonomous body corporate with perpetual succession. It is overseen\nby a Governing Board, chaired by the Executive Chairman, who also serves as the agency's chief\nexecutive and accounting officer. The Executive Chairman is appointed by the President and\nconfirmed by the Senate. The Board includes representatives from Nigeria's six geopolitical zones\nand relevant federal agencies and ministries, ensuring national balance and inter-ministerial\ncoordination.\nAmong other responsibilities, the Board is tasked with:\n• Approving strategic plans and performance frameworks;\n• Overseeing financial and operational policies;\n• Employing and managing staff, and setting remuneration;\n• Monitoring tax policy implementation and recommending reforms where needed.\nOperational Funding and Enforcement\n",
