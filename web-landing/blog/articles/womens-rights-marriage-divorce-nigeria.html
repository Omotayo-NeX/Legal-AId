                <h2>Legal Framework: The Matrimonial Causes Act</h2>
                <p>In Nigeria, marriage and divorce are primarily governed by the <strong>Matrimonial Causes Act</strong> (for statutory marriages) and various customary/Islamic laws (for customary and Islamic marriages). This guide focuses on statutory marriages but also addresses key issues affecting all Nigerian women.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h3>🎯 Know This</h3>
                    <p>Both husband and wife have the <strong>legal right to seek divorce</strong> in Nigeria if the marriage has broken down irretrievably. Gender does not determine who can file.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Grounds for Divorce in Nigeria</h2>
                <p>Under Section 15 of the Matrimonial Causes Act, there is only ONE ground for divorce: <strong>the marriage has broken down irretrievably.</strong></p>

                <h3>Evidence of Irretrievable Breakdown (You must prove ONE of these):</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Adultery</strong> – Your spouse committed adultery and you find it intolerable to live with them</li>
                    <li><strong>Unreasonable Behavior</strong> – Your spouse behaves in a way that you cannot reasonably be expected to live with them</li>
                    <li><strong>Desertion</strong> – Your spouse deserted you for at least one continuous year</li>
                    <li><strong>Separation (2 years)</strong> – You've lived apart for 2+ years and both parties consent to divorce</li>
                    <li><strong>Separation (3 years)</strong> – You've lived apart for 3+ years (no consent needed)</li>
                    <li><strong>Failure to Comply</strong> – Your spouse has failed to comply with a decree of restitution of conjugal rights</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Property Rights: The Hard Truth</h2>
                <p>One of the biggest challenges Nigerian women face in divorce is <strong>property division</strong>. The current legal reality is disappointing:</p>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <h3>⚠️ Important Reality</h3>
                    <p>Nigerian courts <strong>generally do not order equal redistribution of property</strong> at divorce. Property typically goes to whoever has legal title (name on the documents).</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Section 72 of the Matrimonial Causes Act</h3>
                <p>While Section 72 grants courts power to make "just and equitable" property settlement orders, in practice:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Courts rarely use this power to redistribute property</li>
                    <li>Women must prove <strong>substantial financial contribution</strong> to property acquisition</li>
                    <li>Non-financial contributions (homemaking, child-rearing) are often undervalued</li>
                    <li>Property registered solely in the husband's name usually stays with him</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Protecting Yourself:</h3>
                <div style="background: #E3F2FD; padding: 24px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 24px 0;">
                    <h4>Before and During Marriage:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Joint Ownership:</strong> Ensure property is registered in both names</li>
                        <li><strong>Document Contributions:</strong> Keep records of financial contributions to property, businesses, and household</li>
                        <li><strong>Prenuptial Agreements:</strong> Consider prenuptial agreements (increasingly recognized by Nigerian courts)</li>
                        <li><strong>Maintain Financial Independence:</strong> Keep your own bank accounts and income sources</li>
                        <li><strong>Business Partnerships:</strong> If contributing to spouse's business, formalize your role legally</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>Child Custody and Welfare</h2>
                <p>The paramount consideration in custody matters is the <strong>welfare and best interest of the child</strong> – not the rights of parents.</p>

                <h3>Custody Types:</h3>
                <table style="width: 100%; margin: 24px 0; border-collapse: collapse;">
                    <tr style="background: var(--gray-light);">
                        <th style="padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;">Type</th>
                        <th style="padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;">Description</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"><strong>Sole Custody</strong></td>
                        <td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">One parent has physical custody and makes all decisions</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"><strong>Joint Custody</strong></td>
                        <td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">Both parents share decision-making responsibilities</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"><strong>Visitation Rights</strong></td>
                        <td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">Non-custodial parent has scheduled time with child</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>

                <h3>Factors Courts Consider:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Age of the child (young children often stay with mother)</li>
                    <li>Child's preference (if old enough to express a reasoned view)</li>
                    <li>Each parent's ability to provide for the child</li>
                    <li>Existing relationship between child and each parent</li>
                    <li>Stability of each parent's home environment</li>
                    <li>History of abuse or neglect</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Financial Support: Maintenance and Alimony</h2>

                <h3>Child Maintenance</h3>
                <p>Both parents have a <strong>legal duty to financially support their children</strong>, regardless of custody arrangements.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Courts can order the non-custodial parent to pay child support</li>
                    <li>Amount depends on the paying parent's income and child's needs</li>
                    <li>Covers food, clothing, education, healthcare, and shelter</li>
                    <li>Continues until child turns 18 (or 21 if in full-time education)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Spousal Maintenance (Alimony)</h3>
                <p>Nigerian courts <strong>can</strong> order spousal maintenance, but it's not automatic. Factors include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Financial resources and needs of each spouse</li>
                    <li>Standard of living during the marriage</li>
                    <li>Age and health of both parties</li>
                    <li>Duration of the marriage</li>
                    <li>Contributions to the marriage (financial and non-financial)</li>
                    <li>Earning capacity and employment prospects</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Divorce Procedure: Step-by-Step</h2>

                <div style="background: var(--gray-light); padding: 24px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 24px 0;">
                    <h3>Step 1: Filing the Petition</h3>
                    <p>File a divorce petition at the High Court stating grounds for divorce.</p>

                    <h3>Step 2: Serving Your Spouse</h3>
                    <p>The court serves the petition on your spouse, who has time to respond.</p>

                    <h3>Step 3: Decree Nisi</h3>
                    <p>If grounds are proven and no defense succeeds, the court grants a conditional divorce order (Decree Nisi).</p>

                    <h3>Step 4: Decree Absolute (Final)</h3>
                    <p>After 3 months, you can apply for Decree Absolute, which finalizes the divorce.</p>

                    <h3>Timeline:</h3>
                    <p>Uncontested divorce: 6-12 months<br>Contested divorce: 1-3+ years</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Special Protections for Women</h2>

                <h3>Domestic Violence</h3>
                <p>Under the VAPP Act and state domestic violence laws:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can obtain a <strong>protection order</strong> against an abusive spouse</li>
                    <li>Police must respond to domestic violence reports</li>
                    <li>Shelters and support services are available</li>
                    <li>Domestic violence is grounds for divorce</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Economic Abuse</h3>
                <p>Denying you access to family finances, preventing you from working, or controlling all money can constitute economic abuse and unreasonable behavior.</p>

                <h2>Common Questions</h2>

                <div class="faq-section">
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can I get a divorce if my husband refuses?</h3>
                        <p>Yes. If you can prove the marriage has broken down irretrievably (through one of the grounds listed), you can obtain a divorce even without your husband's consent.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Will I get half of everything in divorce?</h3>
                        <p>Unfortunately, not automatically. Nigerian courts don't typically order 50/50 division. You'll need strong evidence of contributions to claim property.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can I take my children out of Nigeria during divorce?</h3>
                        <p>Not without court permission or your spouse's written consent if custody is disputed. Doing so could constitute child abduction.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Do I need a lawyer to get divorced?</h3>
                        <p>While not legally required, having a lawyer is <strong>highly recommended</strong>, especially for contested divorces or when property/custody is at issue.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>While Nigerian law provides pathways for women to exit unhappy or abusive marriages, significant gaps remain – especially in property rights. Knowledge is power: understand your rights, document your contributions, seek legal advice early, and don't hesitate to assert your legal protections.</p>

                <p><strong>Remember:</strong> You have the right to leave a marriage that's harmful to you. You deserve safety, respect, and financial security.</p>
